				<h1>
					Hello!
				</h1>
				<p>
					This is a website for Andy H Phan, and here you'll find 
					all of my projects and how to contact me. If I sent you a 
					<a href = "AndyPhan_Resume26.pdf">resume</a> and you're here 
					to check me out, thank you for visiting!<br><br>
					
					This website itself is made by me in HTML5 and CSS strictly. If I
					decide to learn more about website development, I may update This
					website in the future.<br><br>

					Also, try resizing the window! It is responsive and will fit to all
					types of screens.

							What a headache... Moved the website over to github. It can now be found
							<a href = "https://localtrash.github.io/andyphan/">here</a>, although you're already here.
