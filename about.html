				<h1>
					What About Andy?
				</h1>
				<p>
					I am a student currently studying at the University of Louisville.
					I graduated from duPont Manual High school in 2023, and I found my
					love for Computer Science back then.<br><br>
					
					I have been learning a lot of programming languages, but my most
					proficient ones as of now are Java, C/C++ and Python. If you came
					from my resume and need a refresher, or if you are visiting the page
					for the first time, my resume can be found <a href = "AndyPhan_Resume.pdf">here</a>.
					<br><br>
					
					I am a part of the University of Louisville's Speed ACM Game Development
					Club, to continue to learn new programming languages while also doing
					what I enjoy.
				</p>
				
				<h1>
					Not Just Software
				</h1>
				<p>
					Besides programming though, I also love drawing and playing music
					in my free time. Expressing myself through creative means relaxes
					me, and gives me a feeling of growth outside of school and work.
					<br><br>
					
					In high school, I played Clarinet in the duPont Manual Marching Band. 
					Although I don't play in the band for UofL, I still occasionally try to 
					learn how to play the bass guitar.<br><br>
					
					When I'm really feeling lazy, I also love playing video games. Not
					ones that require a lot of my attention, but ones that I can immerse
					myself into the world of the game I'm playing. As such, a lot of my
					projects I've made have been game-related.
