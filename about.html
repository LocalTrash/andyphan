				<h1>
					What About Andy?
				</h1>
				<p>
					I am a undergraduate student currently studying Computer Science at the University of Louisville.
					While Computer Science is my major focus, Mathematics has always been one of my biggest
					strengths, which is why I am pursuing it as a minor.<br><br>
					
					I have been learning a lot of programming languages, but my most
					proficient ones as of now are Java, C/C++ and Python. If you came
					from my resume and need a refresher, or if you are visiting the page
					for the first time, my resume can be found <a href = "AndyPhan_Resume26.pdf">here</a>.
					<br><br>
					
					During 2024, I was a part of the University of Louisville's Speed ACM Game Development
					Club, which was a fun and unique experience I had working with very talented people!
				</p>
				
				<h1>
					Not Just Software
				</h1>
				<p>
					Besides programming though, I also love drawing and playing music
					in my free time. Expressing myself through creative means relaxes
					me, and gives me a feeling of growth outside of school and work.
					<br><br>
					
					In high school, I played Clarinet in the duPont Manual Marching Band.
					I had played in a band in middle school, but playing in this band was
					nothing like I'd ever done. Working closely with such a diverse group
					of people and being so driven for improvement shaped who I am today. 
					Although I don't play in a band for UofL, I still occasionally try to 
					learn how to play the bass guitar.<br><br>
					
					A lot of my previous projects are game-related, which is because I love to play them.
					When I can't seem to find the inspiration to draw, I often look to games
					to find it.
